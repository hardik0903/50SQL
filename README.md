## Introduction

Hello! I'm Hardik, a passionate coder who loves challenges and problem solving. I embarked on the **50 Day SQL Challenge** to improve my SQL skills and deepen my understanding of databases and query optimization. Join me as I explore various SQL problems, document my solutions, and share my learning experiences over 50 days! ðŸ˜Š

## Challenge Overview

I am following the [50 Day SQL Challenge](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) available on LeetCode to refine my SQL skills. Each day, I will tackle a new SQL problem that covers a wide range of topicsâ€”from basic queries to advanced functions and optimizations.

## Day 1: Recyclable and Low Fat Products

ðŸ”— [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

**Description**:  
Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**

1. Use a `SELECT` query to retrieve the required `product_id`.
2. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows.
3. In the condition, check whether:
   - `low_fats` column has value `'Y'`
   - `recyclable` column also has value `'Y'`
4. Return only those rows that meet both conditions.

ðŸ§  A simple problem to start with, testing your basic SQL filtering skills!

## Day 2: Find Customer Referee

ðŸ”— [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

**Description**:  
Write a solution to find the names of customers who were **not referred by customer with ID = 2**.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**

1. Use a `SELECT` query to fetch the `name` column from the `Customer` table.
2. Use a `WHERE` clause to exclude customers whose `referee_id` is 2.
3. Consider handling `NULL` values for `referee_id` using `IS NULL` or with safe `!=` condition depending on the platform.

ðŸ§  This problem helps understand conditional filtering and dealing with `NULL` values in SQL.
